dfshack--A hack built to make dfs look sorta like a "normal" linux filesystem. 

The point of dfshack is to allow software like KDE (which requires lockfiles) and Cadence (which requires special permissions on data files for god-knows-why) to coexist happily with dfs-mounted home directories. 
Also, in theory this could be used to allow, say, key-based SSH auth to machines with dfs-mounted home directories as well. 

dfshack works by mounting the dfs homedir somewhere else, then copying the files whose permissions need to be changed from their defaults to ~ and chmod'ing them. Files that can keep normal permissions are symlinked from the dfs dir to ~. 
On logout, anything in ~ that's not a symlink is copied back to the dfs mount and then the dfs mount is unmounted. 

In the future I have plans to add support for persistent symlinks in ~ as well as "smart" (automatic) chmod'ing for new files. 

Yes, this might work better as a FUSE driver, but I'm too lazy for that.
