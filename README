dfshack--A hack built to make dfs look sorta like a "normal" linux filesystem. 

The point of dfshack is to allow software like KDE (which requires lockfiles) and Cadence (which requires special permissions on data files for god-knows-why) to coexist happily with dfs-mounted home directories. 

dfshack works by proxying calls to the underlying filesystem and storing/retrieving bits of data the underlying filesystem doesn't in/from a SQLite database. 

Yes, I know I said I was too lazy to write this as a FUSE driver, but it turns out that a giant rsync isn't exactly fast. C'est la vie.
