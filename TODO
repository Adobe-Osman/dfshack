* Locking/file semaphore for the sqlite database
	 * CIFS renames are NOT atomic
	 * CIFS DOES support some flock/fcntl locking mechanisms
* Version table for the database (to help with future dfshack versions)
* old symlinks/permissions file import 
* handle files being deleted on windows (should be fixed)
* Fix lock bug (testable by lock_test.c)
	* d_flush() may need to be implemented as part of the fix
